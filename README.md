# eCommerceProject

Here we are creating an example of an Ecommerce website. In this case a place for an artist to feature their artwork and allow visitors to the site to get an Idea of how much a commission would cost. 

We will build an interface (secret route) for the admin (once verified) to easily monitor and keep track of the customer requests and update the status of each submission.

Server side:


Client side:
This will feature a navigatable interface for viewing/featuring finished artwork using a carousel, upon click will feature across the entire page. 
-As well as a interactive pricing screen to help customers get an idea of the price of certain requests. A submit button that prompts for entering contact information (email). These details will be saved on the server for the admin to navigate and update as needed.
-An about the artist Bio section. Featuring interests, experience and previous employeers
